// Functions must have explicit return values

// Functions inherit the scope in which they're defined...


// variable declarations are hoisted to the top of the current scope, but not their assignment


// Functions can be defined inside of other functions and inherit their scope


// Javascript functions are objects. This means we can store them in a variable. This is called a function expression


// Function declarations are hoisted, while expressions aren't



// We can create a function that returns another function...
